Here's a README.md file tailored for your COVID-19 project based on the provided structure:


# COVID-19 Prediction Project

This project is designed to predict COVID-19 cases and outcomes using machine learning models. It provides a web-based interface built with Flask, allowing users to input data and receive predictions.

## Project Structure

Covid19/ │ ├── models/ # Contains trained machine learning models │ ├── static/ # Static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) for the web app │ ├── templates/ # HTML templates for the Flask web interface │ └── app.py # Main Flask application for running the server and predictions


## Files Description

- **models/**: Contains the trained machine learning models used to predict COVID-19 outcomes.
- **static/**: Includes static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images for styling and enhancing the web application.
- **templates/**: This folder holds the HTML files used by Flask to render the user interface of the web app.
- **app.py**: The core Flask application file that runs the server, handles user inputs, processes predictions, and serves the web pages.
